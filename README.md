# Actra
 **Actra** is a platform that allows developers to create and share blockchain-based actions that can be instantly executed through simple links. These actions can be anything from interacting with smart contracts, making crypto payments, to collecting user inputs. Once an action is created, developers can easily share a unique link on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, and more. Users can click on the link, interact with the blockchain in a seamless way using their wallets, and experience decentralized actions without needing complex setups or installations. Itâ€™s a simple, fast, and powerful way to bring blockchain interactions to the masses.
